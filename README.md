## Directory Structure ##

### `app` ###

The app directory is where the application lives. Most everything that goes into the final app should belong here.

Each type of asset (e.g. images) should have its own subfolder here.

- `/scripts`: compiled [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) files end up here. It can also include vanilla JavaScript files as well, though.
- `/styles`: compiled [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) files end up here. It can also include vanilla CSS files as well, though.

### `src` ###

The src directory holds [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) files before they are compiled. Generally, we use Grunt to compile our source files automatically for us (see our Grunt documentation for how to do that).

- `/scripts`: [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) compiled into app/scripts, retaining directory structure
- `/styles`: [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) compiled into app/styles, retaining directory structure

### `test` ###

The test directory houses the test suite. We use the [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) test framework, and we run our tests with Grunt (see our Grunt documentation for how to do that).

- `/spec`: [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) test source
- `/compiled`: the test suite after compiling; generated by Grunt

### `dist` ###

The dist directory has a complete deployable version of the app ready to go. The build process copies everything straight from the app directory to the dist directory, except for scripts and styles, which are specially processed for optimization, concatenation, and minification.

This directory is always generated completely with Grunt. Ideally, it can be safely deleted and re-generated from source as needed.

### `docs` ###

The docs directory contains the app's documentation, including the changelog, Grunt command documentation, and styleguide.

Markdown in the docs directory will be compiled into HTML and put into the gen subdirectory. This readme will also be compiled into this folder.

- `/gen`: HTML versions of the Markdown files
- `/gen/styleguide`: an auto-generated KSS styleguide

### `grunt` ###

The grunt directory houses configuration for all of the grunt commands. We use the [load-grunt-config](https://github.com/firstandthird/load-grunt-config) npm package to externalize each Grunt package command configuration into this folder. Read more about the different Grunt commands available in the GRUNT.md documentation.

The Grunt configuration files match the name of the Grunt task. They can be valid JavaScript, [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), JSON, or even YAML files.

The main Gruntfile just contains a few global configuration variables, like file paths.

- `/aliases.yaml`: holds all the Grunt aliases

### `bower_components` ###

Installed Bower packages. Regenerate this folder with `bower install`.

### `node_modules` ###

Installed Node packages. Regenerate this folder with `npm install`.

### `.cache` ###

Houses cached files (e.g. the SASS cache that Grunt creates to speed up compiling [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/)). Can be safely deleted (there's even a Grunt task for that). Don't commit this to version control.
